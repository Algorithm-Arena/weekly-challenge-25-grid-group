# Weekly Challenge #25 - Grid Group

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that generates a grid view of various groups of elements.** I discovered this [grid visualization of Google Cloud offerings](https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/) and got nerd sniped into rebuilding it. This challenge is about exploring how to display information in a grid in a different way.
