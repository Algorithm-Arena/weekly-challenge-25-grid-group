# Weekly Challenge #25 - Grid Group

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that generates a grid view of various groups of elements.** I discovered this [grid visualization of Google Cloud offerings](https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/) and got nerd sniped into rebuilding it. This challenge is about exploring how to display information in a grid in a different way.

### Winners:
* The winner for $100 is @michael-azogu! By grouping pixels into a grid, you're able to both compress the image and find edges. And it makes for beautiful pictures ðŸ¤© https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-25-grid-group/issues/3

* In second place for $60 is @alshakero! The execution around showing animals in a 3d-looking grid is just stunning! So simple to implement yet such a powerful visualization. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-25-grid-group/issues/2

* In third place for $40 is @nikpundik! I have to admit, this entry was completely unexpected. This is a mini-game that let's you explore the universe within a grid ðŸš€ https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-25-grid-group/issues/1
